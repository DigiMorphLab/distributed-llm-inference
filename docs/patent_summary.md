# Patent Summary: Distributed Inference for Large Language Models

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the patent titled **"A Computing Task Allocation System and Method for Distributed Inference in Large Language Models."** The patent describes an innovative approach for optimizing large language model (LLM) inference using **distributed task allocation** across mobile and edge devices. 

This patent is based on the **February 2024 prototype and experimental results** from the **DigiMorph Lab team**, demonstrating real-world feasibility and performance improvements in decentralized AI inference. The **core content** of the patent is open-sourced in this repository, while the **full patent has been filed in Australia, the United States, and China in 2024.**

## Key Innovations
### âœ… Distributed Task Allocation for LLMs
- Instead of executing LLMs on a single device, this method **distributes inference tasks** across multiple mobile devices, improving efficiency and reducing latency.

### âœ… Advanced Network-Aware Task Scheduling
- Implements **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** for optimal model partitioning, considering:
  - Model FLOPs, memory constraints, device processing capabilities
  - Network conditions such as **bandwidth, jitter, and packet loss**
  - **Binomial distribution modeling** for packet loss rate

### âœ… Enhanced ONNX-Based Adaptive Model Deployment
- Provides an **end-to-end process** for **model segmentation, conversion, and execution** on Android devices without relying on high-performance GPUs.

### âœ… Robustness in Weak Network Conditions
- Unlike traditional approaches that assume **high-bandwidth, low-latency environments**, this method incorporates **packet loss modeling and jitter adaptation**, ensuring reliable performance even in constrained network settings.

### âœ… Optimized Communication Overhead
- Introduces a **network link quality penalty term** to balance computation and communication trade-offs.
- Implements **effective payload calculations for communication protocols** to enhance transmission efficiency.

## Comparison with Existing Technologies
| Feature | Traditional Cloud Inference | Patent's Distributed Inference |
|---------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|

| **Latency** | High due to network dependency | Low by running locally on mobile devices |
| **Scalability** | Limited by cloud cost | Scales across edge devices |
| **Robustness** | Dependent on network stability | Models packet loss and jitter to improve performance |
| **Cost** | Expensive cloud-based execution | Uses free/low-cost local compute |

## Experimental Validation
This patent is backed by **real-world experiments** conducted on **Pixel 4 XL devices running Android 12+**, using:
- **Environment setup**: Ubuntu in Termux with Conda-based machine learning runtime.
