# Distributed Inference for Large Language Models

## Overview
This repository contains the open-source **patent documentation** for:

_"A Computing Task Allocation System and Method for Distributed Inference in Large Language Models."_

This project focuses on optimizing the inference process of large language models (LLMs) on **mobile devices** by utilizing **distributed task allocation, model segmentation, and linear optimization techniques**. The goal is to enable efficient, low-latency, and cost-effective inference across multiple edge devices.

This patent is based on the **February 2024 prototype and experimental results** from the **DigiMorph Lab team**, demonstrating real-world feasibility and performance improvements in decentralized AI inference. The **core content** of the patent is open-sourced in this repository, while the **full patent has been filed in Australia, the United States, and China in 2024.**


## Key Innovations
### âœ… Distributed Task Allocation for LLMs
- Instead of executing LLMs on a single device, this method **distributes inference tasks** across multiple mobile devices, improving efficiency and reducing latency.

### âœ… Advanced Network-Aware Task Scheduling
- Implements **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** for optimal model partitioning, considering:
  - Model FLOPs, memory constraints, device processing capabilities
  - Network conditions such as **bandwidth, jitter, and packet loss**
  - **Binomial distribution modeling** for packet loss rate

### âœ… Enhanced ONNX-Based Adaptive Model Deployment
- Provides an **end-to-end process** for **model segmentation, conversion, and execution** on Android devices without relying on high-performance GPUs.

### âœ… Robustness in Weak Network Conditions
- Unlike traditional approaches that assume **high-bandwidth, low-latency environments**, this method incorporates **packet loss modeling and jitter adaptation**, ensuring reliable performance even in constrained network settings.

### âœ… Optimized Communication Overhead
- Introduces a **network link quality penalty term** to balance computation and communication trade-offs.
- Implements **effective payload calculations for communication protocols** to enhance transmission efficiency.
